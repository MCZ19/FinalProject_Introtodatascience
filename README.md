This final project for the McCourt School's Intro to Data Class uses appended ACS and D.C. public school data to examine the effect that demographics has on future educational/workforce related outcomes. 
Various lessons learned throughout the Spring 2024 semester are included such as API calls, exploratory data analysis via data vizualisation, geospatial analysis, unsupervised machine learning via K-means clustering, 
and supervised machine learning via a decision tree model. Data imputation on this project was limited and text analysis was not used. 

Results calculated through gap statistics and silhoutte width show that a single k = 1 cluster best represents our data. Our decision tree shows that poverty status is a greater predictor of english language proficiency
on standardized tests than race. Based on poverty status the decision tree can predict 73 percent of the time whether the majority of students in a school are proficient in english (with an 89 percent accuracy).
